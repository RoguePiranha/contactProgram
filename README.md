# Overview

In this project, I developed a simple yet effective command-line application that serves as a contact management system. The application allows users to store and manage their contacts by adding, viewing, and updating contact information such as names and phone numbers. As a software engineer, my aim was to deepen my understanding of C++ language concepts, object-oriented programming, and data structures like maps, while also creating a functional and useful tool.

{Provide a link to your YouTube demonstration. It should be a 4-5 minute demo of the software running and a walkthrough of the code. Focus should be on sharing what you learned about the language syntax.}

## Development Environment

To develop this contact management system, I used the following tools:

- Visual Studio Code as the code editor
- https://www.onlinegdb.com/online_c++_compiler/ for compiling and running the code
- Git for version control and code management

The project is written in C++ and relies on the standard C++ libraries, including <iostream>, <string>, and <map>.

## Future Work

There are several areas in which this project can be improved and expanded:

1. Add more contact information fields, such as email addresses and physical addresses.
2. Improve the user interface by adding a more intuitive menu system.
3. Store the contact list in a file for persistent storage between sessions.
